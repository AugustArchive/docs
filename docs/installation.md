Installing Mue is a simple and straightforward process.

## Google Chrome
To install on Google Chrome, first visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mue/bngmbednanpcfochchhgbkookpiaiaid) page and click on "Add to Chrome". You will then be 
prompted with a permissions dialog asking whether or not you want to add the extension, simply click "Add extension" and Mue will be downloaded and installed. You can then open a new tab to start using Mue.
If prompted with a question asking whether or not you want to accept the new tab changes, click yes.

## Firefox
To install on Firefox, first visit the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/mue) website and click on "Add to Firefox". You will then be prompted with a dialog asking whether
or not you want to add the extension, simply click "Add" and Mue will be downloaded and installed. You can then open a new tab to start using Mue. If prompted with a question asking whether or not you want to accept the new tab changes, 
click yes.

## Local
Installing Mue locally is a little more tricky. On Chromium based browsers, you can visit the extensions page (this is normally accessible through ``<browsername>://extensions``, e.g ``edge://extensions``)
or through the browser dropdown. Then, check the "Developer Mode" toggle. Next, you'll need to download a copy of Mue from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mue/mue/releases) and drag the downloaded .ZIP
file onto the extensions page. You can then open a new tab to start using Mue. If prompted with a question asking whether or not you want to accept the new tab changes, click yes.
